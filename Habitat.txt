The proboscis monkey is endemic to the island of Borneo and can be found in all three nations that divide the island: Brunei, Indonesia and Malaysia.[19] It is most common in coastal areas and along rivers.[20] This species is restricted to lowland habitats that may experience tides.[21][22] It favors dipterocarp, mangrove and riverine forests.[20] It can also be found in swamp forests, stunted swamp forests, rubber forests, rubber plantations, limestone hill forests, nypa swamps, nibong swamps, tall swamp forests, tropical heath forests and steep cliffs.[21] This species usually stays within at least a kilometer from a water source. It is perhaps the most aquatic of the primates and is a fairly good swimmer, capable of swimming up to 20 m (66 ft) underwater. It is known to swim across rivers.[21] Aside from this, the proboscis monkey is largely arboreal and moves quadrupedally and by leaps.[10] It is known to jump off branches and descend into water.
