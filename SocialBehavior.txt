Proboscis monkeys generally live in groups composed of one adult male, some adult females and their offspring.[20][23][24] All-male groups may also exist.[25] Some individuals are solitary, mostly males.[26] Monkey groups live in overlapping home ranges, with little territoriality,[20][23] in a fission-fusion society, with groups gathering at sleeping sites as night falls. There exist bands which arise when groups come together and slip apart yet sometimes groups may join to mate and groom.[20][23][24] Groups gather during the day and travel together, but individuals only groom and play with those in their own group.[24] One-male groups consist of 3 to 19 individuals,[25][20] while bands can consist of as many as 60 individuals.[20][26] Serious aggression is uncommon among the monkeys but minor aggression does occur.[27] Overall, members of the same bands are fairly tolerant of each other. A linear dominance hierarchy exists between females.[23] Males of one-male groups can stay in their groups for six to eight years. Replacements in the resident males appear to occur without serious aggression.[25] Upon reaching adulthood, males leave their natal groups and join all-male groups.[20][26] Females also sometimes leave their natal groups, perhaps to avoid infanticide or inbreeding, reduce competition for food, or elevation of their social status.[25][26]

In Sabah, Malaysia, proboscis monkeys have been observed in mixed-species groups with silvery lutungs, and interspecific mating and a possible hybrid has been observed.[6] Researchers believe this may be a result of the two species being confined to a small patch of riverine forest due to deforestation in order to plant oil palm trees.
