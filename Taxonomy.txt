The proboscis monkey belongs to the subfamily Colobinae of the Old World monkeys. The two subspecies are:[2]

N. l. larvatus (Wurmb, 1787), which occupies the whole range of the species excluding northeast Kalimantan[7]
N. l. orientalis (Chasen, 1940), restricted to north-east Kalimantan[7]
However, the difference between the subspecies is small, and not all authorities recognise N. l. orientalis.[2]

The genus name Nasalis comes from the Latin word nasus meaning "nose".[8][further explanation needed][additional citation(s) needed]

This animal was made known to Westerners by Baron Friedrich von Wurmb in 1781, he later sent specimens of it to Stamford Raffles in Europe.
