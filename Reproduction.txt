Females become sexually mature at the age of five years. They experience sexual swelling, which involves the genitals becoming pink or reddened.[25][28] At one site, matings largely take place between February and November, while births occur between March and May.[29] Copulations tend to last for half a minute.[23][25] The male will grab the female by the ankles or torso and mount her from behind.[23] Both sexes will encourage mating, but they are not always successful.[28] When soliciting, both sexes will make pouted faces. In addition, males will sometimes vocalize and females will present their backsides and shake their head from side to side.[20][28][29][15] Mating pairs are sometimes harassed by subadults.[28] Proboscis monkeys may also engage in mounting with no reproductive purpose, such as playful and same-sex mounting, and females will attempt to initiate copulation even after they have conceived.[15] Gestation usually last 166â€“200 days or slightly more.[29] Females tend to give birth at night or in the early morning. The mothers then eat the placenta and lick their infants clean.[30] The young begin to eat solid foods at six weeks and are weaned at seven months old. The nose of a young male grows slowly until reaching adulthood. The mother will allow other members of her group to hold her infant.[23][29][30] When a resident male in a one-male group is replaced, the infants are at risk of infanticide.
